Which I lived for 16 years
I just moved actually from now, It's by the harbour
And I just always thought it was a really magical place by the harbour
And I guess now they're gonna
Fill it up with concrete and build things and have, um
Restaurants and stuff
Sounds like an outdoor mall to me
So i skipped to the other side
But by the ocean but now I have a shore
Which is very different to harbour
I don't know I guess I'm just really attracted to this sort of
Industrial kinda energy of the
Rough kinda harbour-thing and ships and coming and going
It's quite sort of motivating or something
Usually when I'm in cities, I tend to walk
So even citiеs, I don't know, I go out for a walk
And I always end up by the harbour, somehow"

I am leaving this harbor, giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem too keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

Wanderlust, relentlessly craving
Wanderlust, peel off the layers
Until we get to the core
Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?
Or will I want more?

Lust for comfort suffocates the soul
There's relentless restlessness, liberates me
I feel at home whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace aboard my floating house

Wanderlust, from island to island
Wanderlust, united in movement
Wonderful, I'm joined with you

We've gone through the grinder, suffered loss
Lost to, to which everything flows, an absence which
Attracts floral blooming softly

Soft is my chest, I didn't allow loss
Loss make me hate, didn't harden from pain
This pain we have will always be there
But the sense of full satisfaction too

I opened my heart for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable

Loss of love, we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we, who we are
It defines us, how we overcome it
Recover, repair from loss

Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive, the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac

Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you

Sleep with one eye open, watching our sub-selves

The keel of our ship, these obstacles are just teaching us
So we can merge even deeper into our own personal mineral
Fuse alloy, ship ahoy

The hostility a broken heart endures
The velocity of that injury is returned to thе world
With the same grin showing teeth

In falsetto lullabies with sincerity
I thank her for her integrity

 is ticking
Her once vibrant rebellion 
is fading
I am her hope-keeper
Assure hope
 is there
At, at all times

My ancestress has left all manners
Her pulsating skin rebelling
The doctors she despised
Placed a pacemaker inside her

When you're out of time
Oh, how you look back changes
Did you punish us for leaving?
Are you sure we hurt you?
Was it just not ""living""?

She had idiosyncratic sense of rhythm
Dyslexia, the ultimate freeform
She invents words and adds syllables
Hand-writing, language all her own

I don't have that story in my mouth
When you die, you bring with you what you've given

The machine of her breathed all night
While she rested
Revealed her resilience
And then it, it didn't

You see with your own eyes
But hear with your mother's
There's fear of being absorbed
By the other

By now, we share the same flesh
As much as I tried to escape it
This is no mediocre debris
My ancestress this is

The odour of our final parting
Those have been
The perfumes of separation
For centuries
The perfumes of separation
For centuries

Now, into the air, I am missing him
Is this excess texting a blessing?
Two music nerds obsessing

He reminds me of the love in me
I'm celebrating on a vibrancy
Sending each other MP3s
Falling in love to a song

This handsomest of wickermen
He asked if I could wait for him
Now, how many lightyears this interim
While I fall in love with his songs?

His hands are good in protecting me
Touching and caressing me
But would it be trespassing
Wanting him to be blissing me
Robbing him of his youth?

Cliffhanger like suspension
My longing has formed its own skeleton
Bridging the gap between singletons
Sending each others these songs

The interior of these melodies
Is perhaps where we are meant to be
Our physical union a fantasy
I just fell in love with a song

So, I reserve my own intimacies
I bundle them up in packages
My rawward longing far too visceral
Did I just fall in love with love?"

Farce like patriarchy
Avoided to confront it

Verse 1
]
She always knows when people need stroking
And is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
I dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
Lying naked face down on his bed

She insists on total presence
And knows how to get through to the rest of us
She has entered me thousandfold often
And undone knots at my most awkward

Music, music loves too

She reaches out to orphans and refugees
Embraces them with thermal blankets
Her favourite childhood moments
Were at a hospital for the disabled

I've seen her offer empathy to widows
She attends funerals of strangers
Her strongest memory
Is feeding children with leprosy

Music heals too
I'm here to defend it

Welcome to Biophilia
The love for nature, and all of her manifestations
From the tiniest organism
To the greatest red giant, floating in the farthest realm of the universe
[Verse 2: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
(
Fann ég á fjalli fallega steina
)
With biophilia comes a restless curiosity
An urge to investigate and discover the elusive places where we meet nature
(
Faldi þá alla, vildi þeim leyna
)
Where she plays on our sensеs with colors and senses and forms, perfumеs and smells
(
Huldi þar í hellisskúta heillasteina
)
Their taste and touch of salty wind on the tongue
(
lla mína unaðslegu óskasteina
)
[Verse 3: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
But, much of nature is hidden from us
That we can neither see, nor touch
Like the one phenomenon that can be said to move us more than any other in our daily lives:
(
Langt er nú síðan leit ég þá steina
)
Sound
[verse 4: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
(
Lengur ei man ég óskina neina
)
Sound harnessed by human beings, delivered with generosity and emotion, is what we call:
(
Er þeir skyldu uppfylla um ævidaga
)
Music
(
Ekki frá því skýrir þessa litla saga
)
[verse 5: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
In Biophilia, you will experience how the three come together
(
Gersemar mínar græt ég ei lengur
)
Nature, music, technology
[verse 6: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
Listen, learn, and create
(
Geti þær fundið telpa' eða drengur
)
Now, forget the size of the human body
(
Silfurskæra kristalla með grænu og gráu
)
Remember that you are a gateway between the universal and the microscopic
The unseen forces that stir the depth of your innermost being
And nature, who embraces you at all there is
(
Gullna roðasteina rennda fjólubláu
)
[verse 7: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
We are on the brink of a revolution that will reunite humans with nature, soon new technological innovations
(
Fann ég á fjalli fallega steina
)
Until we get there
Prepare, explore
Biophilia
(
Faldi þá alla, vildi þeim leyna

Fail at creating a flow

Which I lived for 16 years
I just moved actually from now, It's by the harbour
And I just always thought it was a really magical place by the harbour
And I guess now they're gonna
Fill it up with concrete and build things and have, um
Restaurants and stuff
Sounds like an outdoor mall to me
So i skipped to the other side
But by the ocean but now I have a shore
Which is very different to harbour
I don't know I guess I'm just really attracted to this sort of
Industrial kinda energy of the
Rough kinda harbour-thing and ships and coming and going
It's quite sort of motivating or something
Usually when I'm in cities, I tend to walk
So even citiеs, I don't know, I go out for a walk
And I always end up by the harbour, somehow"

I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

Wanderlust, peel off the layers

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?

Lust for comfort suffocates the soul
There's relentless restlessness, liberates me
I feel at home whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace aboard my floating house

Wanderlust, united in movement

We've gone through the grinder, suffered loss
Lost to, to which everything flows, an absence which
Attracts floral blooming softly

Soft is my chest, I didn't allow loss
Loss make me hate, didn't harden from pain
This pain we have will always be there
But the sense of full satisfaction too

I opened my heart for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable

Loss of love, we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we, who we are
It defines us, how we overcome it
Recover, repair from loss

Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive, the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac

I've opened my heart for you
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you

You are my biggest love

One last embrace to tie a sacred ribbon

Dear General MacArthur
With your permission
I offer wishes of good health
During this heat
That burns anything
The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
Recently, fulfilling
Your heart's desire
You removed the whaling
Moratorium
Your gesture brings
A much needed food
To our community
And families
The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
A million year old fossil
I send to you
This comes from my family
And the ancient sea
A prehistoric impression
Of the modern krill
She feeds the noble whale
And offers you longevity
The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
Finally, please take good care in the heat
Sincerely yours
Shizuka"

And I can smell a pinch of hope
To almost have allowed one's fingers, to stroke
The fingers I was given to touch with

But careful, careful
There lies my passion, hidden
There lies my love
I'll hide it under a blanket
Lull it to sleep

I'll keep it in a hidden place

He's the beautifullest, fragilest
Still strong, dark and divine
And the littleness of his movements
He hides himself
He invents a charm to be invisible
Hides in the hair

Can I hide there too?
Hide in the hair of him
Seek solace
Sanctuary

We'll keep in a hidden place
We'll hide in a hidden place"

A way to start the day

No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to thе sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my еyes till they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks

And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I think there was probably several things that brought me to that point, first of all i'd completed sort of a cycle i fell after doing Homogenic and Vespertine and Greatest Hits and I had a chance to go back to the beggining you know where I'm made from
Also, just on a musical level, I've been really spoilеd rotten like the Vеspertine Tour was done with 70 people on-stage, it was almost more people on-stage than in the audience and it's like, you know, I mean how spoiled rotten can you get, you know, where are you gonna go from here like 500 people on-stage, or 10000 you know, so it was kinda time for me to not have more bag of tricks just to go back and make things out of what i'm made of not just sort of show-off-y, you know
And then also i hate to admit it but i, the only way to tell the truth is to say that I was lightly affected by the whole 9/11 and, you know, all these people comming out of the woods that are obsessed with the book that was written 2000 years ago, so part of me wanted to make music that was made by humans like even before that or something and just come up with a better idea or something
So I was really keen on doing songs that would be quite full-bloodied and visceral just to prove that you didn't have to make a new-age album, like a linear album, if you're gonna make only vocals, or ambient albums, you know, with full respect to ambient the music but, eh
And it wasn't actually until the end of the album where it sort of slowly became possible, and actually realistic that it actually could be an all-vocal album, 'cus I did set up to work with a lot of vocals but maybe not be, like, puritan, you know
Also, I keep going back and back to is that when I was about 18 I was working- I was in a band called Kukl and we were all doing side-projects with eachother and I would do with the drummer, I would do this stuff where I was recording in the studio layers of myself, vocals, that sort of I would say is a bit out of the roots to Medúlla and also doing a project with a guitarrist from Kukl with this song Sidasta Eg is from"

And I can smell a pinch of hope
To almost have allowed one's fingers, to stroke
The fingers I was given to touch with

Lull it to sleep

Still strong, dark and divine
And the littleness of his movements
Hides himself
He invents a charm that makes him invisible
Hides in the hair

Can I hide there too?

Seek solace

And lives that were over before they were spent
I've seen what I was, and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all — there is no more to see

The home you will share?

I have seen water, it's water, that's all

Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
To be honest, I really don't care

I've seen it all, I have seen the dark
I have seen the brightness in one little spark
I've seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
And that is enough, to want more would be greed

And throw little things off
Like car parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around

It's become a habit
A way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's real early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes till they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks

And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I go through all this

[Verse 3: Rodney P & 
Björk
]
I had a dream that I was missing you, indeed
And if I miss you then you know that I'll be there with speed
I got that mystical vibe for your mind, believe
I've never seen you but I've seen you got the vibes I need
That's why I miss ya, can't dismiss ya from my mind (
Miss you
)
Whole heap of people wan fi diss ya, but I seek to find
You got to send me an emotion, or a sign
'Cause even though we know all things must reveal in time
Still I miss ya (
Miss you, miss you
)

I get so impatient
I can't stand the wait
When will I get my cuddle?
Who are you?
I know by now that you'll arrive
By the time I stop waiting

Miss you

I'm walking hills and valleys
Adore this mystical fog!
This fucking mist!
These cliffs are just showing off!

Then the body memory kicks in
I mime my home mountains
The moss that I'm made of
I redeem myself

I've been wrestling my fate
Do I accept this ending?
Will I accept my death
Or struggle claustrophobic?
Fought like a wolverine
With my destiny
Refuse to accept what was meant to be

Then the body memory kicks in
And I trust the unknown
Unfathomable imagination
Surrender to future

Oh, how to capture all this love
And find a pathway for it
Like threading an ocean through a needle
River through a keyhole
Can't fathom the grasp
I can't grasp the fathom

Then my body memory kicks in
My limbs and tongue take over
Like the ancestors before me
Show me the flow

My sexual DNA
X-rays of my Kama Sutras
Summons different bodies
Compares spines and buttocks
And back of necks

Then my body memory kicks in
It simply takes over
Bestiality
I redeem my body

I wasn't born urban
Toxic doesn't agree with me
Love lured me here
Into a stagnant state
My myths, my customs, ridiculed
Vacuum packed molecules

Then my body memory kicks in
On this Brooklyn dance floor
Sweating with these rhythms
Rotate this matrix

All trapped in legal harness
Kafkaesque
Farce like patriarchy
Avoided to confront it

Then the body memory kicks in
My warrior awakens
My turn to defend
Urban didn't tame me

Then my body memory kicks in
All bosoms and embraces
Oral, anal entrances
Enjoy the satisfaction
If the other is growing"

My ancestress' clock
 is ticking
Her once vibrant rebellion 
is fading
I am her hope-keeper
Assure hope
 is there
At, at all times

My ancestress has left all manners
Her pulsating skin rebelling
The doctors she despised
Placed a pacemaker inside her

When you're out of time
Oh, how you look back changes
Did you punish us for leaving?
Are you sure we hurt you?
Was it just not ""living""?

She had idiosyncratic sense of rhythm
Dyslexia, the ultimate freeform
She invents words and adds syllables
Hand-writing, language all her own

I don't have that story in my mouth
When you die, you bring with you what you've given

The machine of her breathed all night
While she rested
Revealed her resilience
And then it, it didn't

You see with your own eyes
But hear with your mother's
There's fear of being absorbed
By the other

By now, we share the same flesh
As much as I tried to escape it
This is no mediocre debris
My ancestress this is

The odour of our final parting
Those have been
The perfumes of separation
For centuries
The perfumes of separation
For centuries

It expands this realm
Translucent skin let go of
A cold palm embalmed"

Stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
