Silence,"Esteja alerta para as regras dos três
O que você dá, retornará para você
Essa lição, você tem que aprender
Você só ganha o que você merece


Tempted in our minds
Tormented inside lie
Wounded and afraid
Inside my head
Falling through changes

Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?

Empty in our hearts
Crying out in silence
Wandered out of reach
Too far to speak
Drifting unable

Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?"
Hunter,"No one said
We'd ever known each other
And new evidence is what we require
In this world

I stand on the edge of a broken sky
And I'm broken down, don't know why

And if I should fall, would you hold me?
Would you pass me by?
Oh, you know I'd ask you for nothin'
Just to wait for a while

So confused
My thoughts are takin' over
Unwanted horizons place me instead
Won't let go

I stand on the edge of a broken sky
And I will come down, don't know why

And if I should fall, would you hold me?
Would you pass me by?
Oh, you know I'd ask you for nothin'
Just to wait for a while"
Nylon Smile,"I'd like to laugh at what you said
But I just can't find a smile
I wonder why you can't
I struggle with myself
Hoping I might change a little
Hoping that I might be someone I wanna be

Looking out, I wanna know someone might care
Looking out, I want a reason to be there
'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve you
And I don't know what I'll do without you


Looking out, I wanna know some way might clear
Looking out, I want a reason to repair
'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve you
And I don't know what I'll do without you

I can't see nothing good, nothing is so bad
I never had the chance to explain exactly what I meant"
The Rip,"As she walks in the room
Centered and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realize that love flows

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?


Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?"
Plastic,"I wonder why
I don't know what you see
Of course I care
I won't pretend

It's just a thought
I've said enough
Don't you know life turns me?
Always wants me
I can hardly pray

I could try
But don't know what you hear
'Cause in my heart
You were so clear

It's just a thought
I've said enough
Don't you know life turns me?
Always wants me
I can hardly pray

On your stage
A show that you create
All by yourself
I am nowhere
You never noticed
You were so sure

Don't you know life turns me?
Always wants me
I can hardly pray"
We Carry On,"The taste of life, I can't describe
It's choking up my mind
I'm reaching out, I can't believe
The faith, it can't decide

On and on, I carry on
But underneath my mind
And on and on, I tell myself
It's this I can't disguise

Oh, can't you see?
Holding on to my heart, I plead
The taste of life

The pace of the time, I can't survive
It's grinding down the view
I'm breaking out, which way to choose?
A choice I can't renew

On and on, I carry on
But underneath my mind
And on and on, I tell myself
It's this I can't disguise

Oh, can't you see?
Holding on to my heart, I plead
No place is safe, can't you see?
The taste of life"
Deep Water,"I'm driftin' in deep waters
Alone with my self-doubtin' again
I try not to struggle this time
For I will weather the storm

I gotta remember (
Gotta remember
)
Don't fight it (
Don't fight it
)
Even if I (
Even if I
)
Don't like it (
Don't like it
)
Somehow turn me around (
Somehow turn me around
)

No matter how far I drift
Deep waters (
Deep waters
)
Won't scare me tonight"
Machine Gun,"I saw a savior, a savior come my way
I thought I'd see it at the cold light of day
But now I realize that I'm only for me

If only I could see you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place, no one else I face
No remedy will agree with how I feel

Here in my reflecting, what more can I say?
For I am guilty for the voice that I obey
Too scared to sacrifice a choice chosen for me

If only I could see you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place, no one else I face
No remedy to agree with how I feel"
Small,"If I remember the night that we met
Tasted a wine that I'll never forget
Opened the doorway and saw through the light
Motions of movement and I felt delight

She spoke of freedom, ""A way in,"" she said
""A wisdom that took me away from the bed""
Spoke of the glory that we had become
I felt forgiven in all I've become

Small, tasteless, and flawed
Hoping to see, blinded like me
You tried to understand, but you're just a man
Open to scorn just like me
Failure again
Tried to pretend
Who you were then
Who you are now
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lord


Small, tasteless, and flawed
Hoping to see, blinded like me
You tried to understand, but you're just a man
Open to scorn just like me
Failure again
Tried to pretend
Who you were then
Who you are now
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lord"
Magic Doors,"I can't deny what I've become
I'm just emotionally undone
I can't deny, I can't be someone else
When I have tried to find the words
To describe this sense absurd
Try to resist my thoughts, but I can't lie

I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for

I can't divide or hide from me
I don't know who I'm meant to be
I guess it's just the person that I am
Often I've dreamt that I don't wake
Enjoy the gift of my mistake
But yet again, I'm wrong and I confess

I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for

I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for"
Threads,"Better if I could find the words to say
Whenever I take a choice, it turns away

I'm worn, tired of my mind
I'm worn out, thinking of why
I'm always so unsure

I battle my thoughts, I find I can't explain
I've travelled so far but somehow feel the same

I'm worn, tired of my mind
I'm worn out, thinking of why
I'm always so unsure
I'm always so unsure


I'm worn, tired of my mind
I'm worn out, thinking of why
I'm always so unsure
I'm always so unsure (I'm always so unsure)
I'm always so unsure (I'm always so unsure)
I'm always so unsure

With why, where will I sleep?
While I know in all that I go?
I can't find no one to blame
Stand there, tired and worn
Tired and worn, tired and worn
Tired and worn, tired and worn
Tired, worn, where do I go?"
Humming - Live,"Closer
No hesitation
Give me
All that you have

'Cause it's been so long, that I can't, I can't explain
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong

Naked
My thoughts are creeping
Too late
The show has begun

And it's been so long, that I can't confess
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong


Is it all as it seems?
So unresolved, so unredeemed
If I remain, how will I know?

'Cause it's been so long, that I can't be sure
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong"
Cowboys - Live,"Did you sweep us far from your feet?
Reset in stone this stark belief?
Salted eyes and a soiled dye
Too many years

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Did you feed us tales of deceit?
Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin
The truth is sold, the deal is done

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Undefied, no signs of regret
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise
But no return, the time has come

So don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Oh, if you take these things from me"
All Mine - Live,"All the stars may shine bright
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
Oh, how I feel so good
That I can hardly wait
To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me

All mine
You have to be

From that cloud number nine
Danger starts the sharp incline
And such sad regrets
Oh, as those starry skies
As they swiftly fall
Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me

All mine
You have to be

So don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day
Until the day I die

All mine
You have to be"
Mysterons - Live,"Inside, you're pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere
Where they can forget

Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean
Will not be grasped

All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares
Who dares to condemn?

All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want"
Only You - Live,"""It's like that""
""It's like that""
""It's like that""
""It's like that""

We suffer every day
What is it for?
These crimes of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary and I feel like I do

It's only you who can tear me apart
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight
It's just a dream
We've crushed everything I can see
In this morning selfishly
How we've failed and I feel like I do

It's only you who can tear me apart
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart

""It's like that""
""It's like that""
""It's like that""
""It's like—, it's like—, it's like that""

Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn
A stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

And it's only you who can tear me apart
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart
It's only you who can tear me apart
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart"
Half Day Closing - Live,"In the days of golden days
When everybody knew what they wanted
It ain't here today
Through the times of lasting love
When parents talked of things tried and tested
It don't feel the same

Dreams and belief have gone
Time, life itself goes on

Far beyond the shrinking skies
Where money talks and leaves us hypnotized
It don't pave the way
Underneath the fading sun
The silent sum of a businessman
Has left us choking

Dreams and belief have gone
Time, life itself goes on

In the days, the golden days
When everybody knew what they wanted
It ain't here today

Dreams and belief have gone
Time, life itself goes on"
Over - Live,"I can't hold this day anymore
Understand me anymore

To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?
Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over

I can't mold this stage anymore
Recognize me anymore

To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?
Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over


To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?
Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
Is taking me over

Oh, it's all over, yeah
Oh, it's all over, yeah
Oh, oh oh"
Glory Box - Live,"I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
I'm gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room, yeah

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
'Cause it's all I wanna be, is all, a woman, yeah

For this is the beginning
Of forever and ever
It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
I'm gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be"
Sour Times - Live,"To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Nobody loves me, it's true, oh, no
Nobody loves me, not like you do, oh
It's just like it seems, only disturbed
Oh, nobody loves me, not like you do
Thank you all very much"
Roads - Live,"Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment, how can it feel this wrong?

Storm in the morning light
I feel, no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
Surely that ain't right

Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
We never find our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment, how can it feel this wrong?


How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment, how can it feel this wrong?

From this moment, how can it feel this wrong?"
Strangers - Live,"Oh, can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realize no one can see inside your view?
Did you realize for why this sight belongs to you?

Oh, just set aside your fears of life
With the sole desire

Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side
Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side


Done it warning, done it now
And it ain't real
Done it warning, done it now

Undenied,"Your softly spoken words
Release my whole desire
Undenied
Totally

And so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong?

Beneath your tender touch
My senses can't divide
Oh so strong
My desire

For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong?

Now that I've found you
And seen behind those eyes
How can I
Carry on

For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong?
Belong?
Belong?
Belong?"

Mourning Air,"Did I see a moment with you
In a half lit world
I'm frightened to believe
But I must try
If I stumble if I fall

I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohh

Have I got the strength to ask
Beyond the window
I feel this fear alone
Until we have
Total honesty
If I tremble or fall

I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohh

Should I feel a moment with you
To softly whisper
I crave nothing else so much
Longing to reveal
Total honesty
I can feel your touch

I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohh

I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohh"
Seven Months,"How can I forget you
Disregard how I feel
Silently listen
To the words I can't see

As long as I have tried
As low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek

Why should I forgive you
After all that I've seen
Quietly whisper
When my heart wants to scream

For as long as I have tried
And as low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek

There's no time to rest
Or to reconsider
For this cruel unsaid
Won't concede

For as long as I have tried
And as low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek"
Only You,"{Scratches}

Elysium,"No one has said
What the truth should be
And no one decided
That I'd feel this way
If you felt as I
Would you betray yourself?

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

No one should fear
What they cannot see
And no one's to blame
It's just hypocrisy
It's written in your eyes
And how I despise myself

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

And it's your heart
That's so wrong
Mistaken
You'll never know
Your feathered sacred self

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And you can't deny how I feel
Oh, why should you decide for me?"
Western Eyes,"Forgotten throes of another's life
The heart of love is our only light
Faithless screeds, consolidating
Holding down sweet charity

With western eyes and serpents' breath
We lay our own conscience to rest

But I'm aching at the view
Yes, I'm breaking at the seams just like you

They have values of a certain taste
The innocent they can hardly wait
To crucify, invalidating
Turning to dishonesty

With western eyes and serpents' breath
They lay their own conscience to rest
But then they lie and then they dare to be
Hidden heroes candidly

So, I'm aching at the view
Yes, I'm breaking at the seams just like you

I feel so cold
All hookers and gin
This mess we're in"

It Could Be Sweet,"I don't want to hurt you
For no reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear

I'm sorry to remind
But I'm scared of what we're creating
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
Like a long forgotten dream

And we don't need them
To cast the fate we have
Love don't always shine through

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet

But the thoughts we try to deny
Take a toll upon our lives
We struggle on in depths of pride
Tangled up in single minds

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet"
Wandering Star,"Please, could you stay awhile to share my grief
For it's such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake

Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

Those who have seen the needle's eye, now tread
Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey

Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

Doubled up inside
Take a while to share my grief
Always doubled up inside
Taunted, cruel

Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever"
It'S A Fire,"It's a fire
These dreams that pass me by
This salvation I desire
Keeps getting me down
'Cause we need to
Recognize mistakes
For time and again

So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, sister, breathe on

From this oneself
Testify or tell
It's fooling us now

So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, little sister, breathe on
Ah, so breathe on, little sister, like a fool"
Numb,"I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit

'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy

'Cause the child rose as light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breathe this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear

'Cause the child rose as life
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

A lady of woe
A lady of woe"
Roads,"Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

Storm in the morning light
I feel, no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
Surely that ain't right

Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?


How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?"
Pedestal,"How can I believe this miracle
Where the wind blows dry?
Through the force of a man
Undenied by his eye?

Oh, you abandoned me, how I suffer
Ridicule breathes a sigh
You abandoned me, lost forever
Hush, can you hear?

Enter and rejoice this pedestal
Where the rainbows hide
Your destiny
Mystery of all time

Oh, no time, make, or reason
Ridicule breathes a sigh
No time, make, or reason
Hush, hear him cry


No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason"
Biscuit,"I'm lost, exposed
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt a long time ago
I can't make myself heard

No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

Full fed, yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Haunted, I tell myself, yet I still wander
Down inside

It's tearing me apart, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)

At last, relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson tastes divine
I can't make myself heard

No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)"
Glory Box,"I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just...

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room, yeah

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman


So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

It's all I wanna be, is all, a woman
For this is the beginning
Of forever and ever
It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you"
Chase The Tear,"Looking out, looking in
Going where never been
Running round my defenses
Been afraid, felt the grain
Open doorways full of shame
My own life I resented

Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow

Rushing out, Rushing in
Losing out, losing the
Identity of my heart
Didn't fold, chase the tear
Never let go, now I'm there
It's over, it's over

Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
So I won't anymore
Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
So I won't anymore"
The Rip,"As she walks in the room
Centered and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realize that love flows

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?


Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?"
Silence - Portishead In Portishead,"Esteja alerta para as regras dos três
O que você dá, retornará para você
Essa lição, você tem que aprender
Você só ganha o que você merece


Tempted in our minds
Tormented inside lie
Wounded and afraid
Inside my head
Falling through changes

Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?

Empty in our hearts
Crying out in silence
Wandered out of reach
Too far to speak
Drifting unable

Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?"
Magic Doors - Single Version,"I can't deny what I've become
I'm just emotionally undone
I can't deny, I can't be someone else
When I have tried to find the words
To describe this sense absurd
Try to resist my thoughts, but I can't lie

I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for

I can't divide or hide from me
I don't know who I'm meant to be
I guess it's just the person that I am
Often I've dreamt that I don't wake
Enjoy the gift of my mistake
But yet again, I'm wrong and I confess

I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for

I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for"
Elysium - Parlour Talk Remix,"No one has said
What the truth should be
And no one decided
That I'd feel this way
If you felt as I
Would you betray yourself?

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

No one should fear
What they cannot see
And no one's to blame
It's just hypocrisy
It's written in your eyes
And how I despise myself

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

And it's your heart
That's so wrong
Mistaken
You'll never know
Your feathered sacred self

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And you can't deny how I feel
Oh, why should you dеcide for me?"

All Mine,"All the stars may shine a-bright
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
Oh, how I feel so good
That I can hardly wait
To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me

All mine
You have to be

From that cloud number nine
Danger starts the sharp incline
And such sad regrets
Oh, as those starry skies
As they swiftly fall
Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me

All mine
You have to be

So don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day
Until the day I die

All mine
You have to be"

Cowboys,"Did you sweep us far from your feet?
Reset in stone this stark belief?
Salted eyes and a sordid dye
Too many years

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Did you feed us tales of deceit?
Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin
The truth is sold, the deal is done

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Undefied, no signs of regret
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise
But no return, the time has come

So don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Oh, if you take these things from me"

Sour Sour Times,"To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves mе, it's true
Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I havе left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

After time, the bitter taste
Of innocence, descent, or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide

Theme From 'To Kill A Dead Man',
Numb,"I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit

'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy

'Cause the child rose as light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breathe this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear

'Cause the child rose as life
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

A lady of woe
A lady of woe"
