Esteja alerta para as regras dos três
O que você dá, retornará para você
Essa lição, você tem que aprender
Você só ganha o que você merece
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
Tempted in our minds
Tormented inside lie
Wounded and afraid
Inside my head
Falling through changes
[Chorus]
Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?
[Verse 2]
Empty in our hearts
Crying out in silence
Wandered out of reach
Too far to speak
Drifting unable
[Chorus]
Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?"

No one said
We'd ever known each other
And new evidence is what we require
In this world
[Pre-Chorus]
I stand on the edge of a broken sky
And I'm broken down, don't know why
[Chorus]
And if I should fall, would you hold me?
Would you pass me by?
Oh, you know I'd ask you for nothin'
Just to wait for a while
[Verse 2]
So confused
My thoughts are takin' over
Unwanted horizons place me instead
Won't let go
[Pre-Chorus]
I stand on the edge of a broken sky
And I will come down, don't know why

And if I should fall, would you hold me?
Would you pass me by?

I'd like to laugh at what you said
But I just can't find a smile
I wonder why you can't
I struggle with myself
Hoping I might change a little
Hoping that I might be someone I wanna be

Looking out, I wanna know someone might care
Looking out, I want a reason to be there
'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve you
And I don't know what I'll do without you

As she walks in the room
Centered and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realize that love flows
[Chorus]
Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Always wants me

You were so clear

I've said enough

If I remember the night that we met
Tasted a wine that I'll never forget
Opened the doorway and saw through the light
Motions of movement and I felt delight

She spoke of freedom, ""A way in,"" she said
""A wisdom that took me away from the bed""
Spoke of the glory that we had become
I felt forgiven in all I've become

Hoping to see, blinded like me

I can't deny what I've become
I'm just emotionally undone

To describe this sense absurd
Try to resist my thoughts, but I can't lie

I can't divide or hide from me

Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin

As she walks in the room
Centered and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realize that love flows
[Chorus]
Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?
[Verse 2]
Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over
[Chorus]
Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Esteja alerta para as regras dos três
O que você dá, retornará para você
Essa lição, você tem que aprender
Você só ganha o que você merece
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
Tempted in our minds
Tormented inside lie
Wounded and afraid
Inside my head
Falling through changes
[Chorus]
Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?
[Verse 2]
Empty in our hearts
Crying out in silence
Wandered out of reach
Too far to speak
Drifting unable
[Chorus]
Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?"

I can't deny what I've become
I'm just emotionally undone
I can't deny, I can't be someone else
When I have tried to find the words
To describe this sense absurd
Try to resist my thoughts, but I can't lie
[Chorus]
I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for
[Verse 2]
I can't divide or hide from me
I don't know who I'm meant to be
I guess it's just the person that I am
Often I've dreamt that I don't wake
Enjoy the gift of my mistake
But yet again, I'm wrong and I confess
[Chorus]
I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for
[Chorus]
I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for"
