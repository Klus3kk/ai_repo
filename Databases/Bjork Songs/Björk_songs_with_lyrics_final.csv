Which I lived for 16 years
I just moved actually from now, It's by the harbour
And I just always thought it was a really magical place by the harbour
And I guess now they're gonna
Fill it up with concrete and build things and have, um
Restaurants and stuff
Sounds like an outdoor mall to me
So i skipped to the other side
But by the ocean but now I have a shore
Which is very different to harbour
I don't know I guess I'm just really attracted to this sort of
Industrial kinda energy of the
Rough kinda harbour-thing and ships and coming and going
It's quite sort of motivating or something
Usually when I'm in cities, I tend to walk
So even citiеs, I don't know, I go out for a walk
And I always end up by the harbour, somehow"

I am leaving this harbor, giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem too keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

Was it something like this I wished for?

Lust for comfort suffocates the soul
There's relentless restlessness, liberates me

Wonderful, I'm joined with you

Lost to, to which everything flows, an absence which
Attracts floral blooming softly

Loss make me hate, didn't harden from pain

But the sense of full satisfaction too

Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically

Loss of love, we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we, who we are
It defines us, how we overcome it
Recover, repair from loss

Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive, the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac

Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you

Tied ribbons on my ankles for you

Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically

Thank you for staying while we learn
To find our resonance where we do connect
To find our resonance where we do connect

If we don't grow outwards towards love
We'll implode inwards towards destruction
If my plant doesn't reach towards you
There's internal erosion towards all
Pursuing the light too hard is a form of hiding

To insist on absolute justice at all times

The hostility a broken heart endures
The velocity of that injury is returned to thе world

We dissolve old habits and place a glass egg above us floating
In the dark blood red oval void
Our lovemaking avatars in a shell"

Dyslexia, the ultimate freeform

Into the shape of the love we created
Our emotional hammock
[Verse 2]
Safe inside the fabric of our
Love-woven membrane
[Verse 3]
Everytime we kiss
Share songs and films
Hike mountains and beaches
Our joined presence gains form
Our affections
Captured in a structure
Visceral sculpting
Of our love into space
[Verse 4]
If we cling to what we used to be
It will burn our soul
We will get hurt
Unless therе is absolute trust
Then we will bеcome one
Become one
[Outro]
Our solar systems coalesced
Softly surrendered into itself
Formed a nebulous cloud
A gentle meeting of gas and dust
We amalgamate
Arctic persian compassionate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate

Sending each other MP3s
Falling in love to a song

He asked if I could wait for him
Now, how many lightyears this interim
While I fall in love with his songs?

His hands are good in protecting me
Touching and caressing me
But would it be trespassing
Wanting him to be blissing me
Robbing him of his youth?

Cliffhanger like suspension
My longing has formed its own skeleton
Bridging the gap between singletons
Sending each others these songs

Is perhaps where we are meant to be

Somehow I'm not too bothered either way
I refuse, it's a sign of maturity
To be stuck in complexity
I demand all clarity

Maybe he will come out of this
Or he will feel solitaire
Somehow I'm not too bothered
I'd just like to know"

I wake you up
In the middle of the night
To express my love for you
Stroke your skin and feel you
Naked I can feel all of you
At the same moment

I wake you up
In the night feeling
This is our last time together
Therefore sensing all the moments
We've been together
Being here at the same time
Every single touch
We ever touch each other
Every single fuck
We had together
Is in a wondrous time lapse
With us here at this moment
The history of touches
Every single archive
Compressed into a second
All with us here as I wake you up"

Our love was my womb
But our bond has broken
My shield is gone

I am one wound
My pulsating body

My heart is enormous lake
Black with potion
I am blind
Drowning in this ocean

My soul torn apart
My spirit is broken

You fear my limitless emotions
I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
Did I love you too much?
Devotion bent me broken
So I rebelled
Destroyed the icon

I did it for love
I honoured my feelings
You betrayed your own heart
Corrupted that organ

Family was always
Our sacred mutual mission
Which you abandoned

You have nothing to give
Your heart is hollow

No hope in sight of ever recover
Eternal pain and horrors

I burn off layer by layer"

Is there a place
Where I can pay respects
For the death of my family?
Show some respect
Between the three of us
There is the mother and the child
Then there is the father and the child
But no man and a woman
No triangle of love

So, where do I go
To make an offering?
I fall on my knees
Lay my flowers
Burn incense
Light the candles
So, where do I go
To make an offering?
To mourn our miraculous triangle?
Father, mother, child
Father, mother, child

How will I sing us
Out of this sorrow?
Build a safe bridge
For the child out of this danger, danger
[Verse 4]
I raise a monument of love
There is a swarm of sound
Around our heads
And we can hear it
And we can get healed by it
It will relieve us from the pain
It will make us a part of
This universe of solutions
This place of solutions
This location of solutions

[Verse 1: David Attenborough]
Welcome to Biophilia
The love for nature, and all of her manifestations
From the tiniest organism
To the greatest red giant, floating in the farthest realm of the universe
[Verse 2: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
(
Fann ég á fjalli fallega steina
)
With biophilia comes a restless curiosity
An urge to investigate and discover the elusive places where we meet nature
(
Faldi þá alla, vildi þeim leyna
)
Where she plays on our sensеs with colors and senses and forms, perfumеs and smells
(
Huldi þar í hellisskúta heillasteina
)
Their taste and touch of salty wind on the tongue
(
lla mína unaðslegu óskasteina
)
[Verse 3: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
But, much of nature is hidden from us
That we can neither see, nor touch
Like the one phenomenon that can be said to move us more than any other in our daily lives:
(
Langt er nú síðan leit ég þá steina
)
Sound
[verse 4: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
(
Lengur ei man ég óskina neina
)
Sound harnessed by human beings, delivered with generosity and emotion, is what we call:
(
Er þeir skyldu uppfylla um ævidaga
)
Music
(
Ekki frá því skýrir þessa litla saga
)
[verse 5: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
In Biophilia, you will experience how the three come together
(
Gersemar mínar græt ég ei lengur
)
Nature, music, technology
[verse 6: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
Listen, learn, and create
(
Geti þær fundið telpa' eða drengur
)
Now, forget the size of the human body
(
Silfurskæra kristalla með grænu og gráu
)
Remember that you are a gateway between the universal and the microscopic
The unseen forces that stir the depth of your innermost being
And nature, who embraces you at all there is
(
Gullna roðasteina rennda fjólubláu
)
[verse 7: David Attenborough & 
Graduale Nobili
]
We are on the brink of a revolution that will reunite humans with nature, soon new technological innovations
(
Fann ég á fjalli fallega steina
)
Until we get there
Prepare, explore
Biophilia
(
Faldi þá alla, vildi þeim leyna
)
(
Alla mína unaðslegu óskasteina

Hands of the gods
Came down and gently

[Verse 1]
It may not always be so
And I say that if your lips
Which I have loved
Should touch another's
And your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
As mine in time not far away
[Verse 2]
If on another's face your sweet hair lay
In such a silence as I know
Or such great writhing words, as uttering overmuch
Stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
[Verse 3]
If this should be, I say
If this should be
You of my heart, send me a little word
That I may go unto her, and take her hands saying
Accept all happiness from me
Then I shall turn my face
And hear one birds sing terribly afar in the lost lands"

I shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
You know I gave it all
Trying to match our continents
To change seasonal shift
To form a mutual core

To counteract distance
You know I gave it all
Can you hear the effort
Of the magnetic strife?
Shuffling of columns
To form a mutual core

This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule

This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know, you didn't know

What you resist persists
Nuance makes heat
To counteract distance
I know you gave it all
Offered me harmony
If things were done your way
My Eurasian plate subsumed
Forming a mutual core

You didn't know I had it in me
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule

When she, when found your love
Her nature bowed her head

She renounced the world for you

By demands you cannot answer

Why this sacrifice?
Now she regrets the whole thing
A delayed reaction
When she left her craft voluntarily
For your nest, for your love
Did you understand?

Build a bridge to her
Initiate a touch
Before it's too late
Say the words to her
That will make her shine
Tell her that you love her

Fill it up with concrete and build things and have, um
Restaurants and stuff
Sounds like an outdoor mall to me
So i skipped to the other side
But by the ocean but now I have a shore
Which is very different to harbour
I don't know I guess I'm just really attracted to this sort of
Industrial kinda energy of the
Rough kinda harbour-thing and ships and coming and going

[Verse 1]
I am leaving this harbor, giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem too keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs
[Chorus]
Wanderlust, relentlessly craving
Wanderlust, peel off the layers
Until we get to the core
Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?
Or will I want more?
[Verse 2]
Lust for comfort suffocates the soul
There's relentless restlessness, liberates me
I feel at home whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace aboard my floating house

Wanderlust, from island to island
Wanderlust, united in movement
Wonderful, I'm joined with you

We all are struggling, just doing our best
We've gone through the grinder, suffered loss
Lost to, to which everything flows, an absence which
Attracts floral blooming softly
[Verse 2]
Soft is my chest, I didn't allow loss
Loss make me hate, didn't harden from pain
This pain we have will always be there
But the sense of full satisfaction too
[Chorus 1]
I opened my heart for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable
[Verse 3]
Loss of love, we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we, who we are
It defines us, how we overcome it
Recover, repair from loss
[Verse 4]
Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive, the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac
[Chorus 2]
I've opened my heart for you
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable"

As the lukewarm
Hands of the gods
Came down and gently
Picked my adrenalin pearls
They placed them in their mouths
And rinsed all the fear out
Nourished them with their saliva

As if the healthiest past time
Is being in life-threatening circumstances
And once again be reborn

Best way to start anew
Is to fail miserably
Fail at loving and fail at giving
Fail at creating a flow
Then realign the whole
And kick into the start hole
And kick into the start hole
And kick into the start hole

To risk all is the end-all and the beginning all

Receiving radiance from others

But it hasn’t happened yet
You are gorgeous
But I haven't met you yet
I remember
But it hasn't happened yet

And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
Than a dream can come true

I was peaking
But it hasn’t happened yet
I haven't been given
My best souvenir
I miss you
But I haven't met you yet
I know your habits
But wouldn't recognize you yet

And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true

I'm so impatient
I can't stand the wait
When will I get my cuddle?
Who are you?
I know by now that you'll arrive
By the time I stop waiting

Dear General MacArthur
With your permission
I offer wishes of good health
During this heat
That burns anything
The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
Recently, fulfilling
Your heart's desire
You removed the whaling
Moratorium
Your gesture brings
A much needed food
To our community
And families
The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
A million year old fossil
I send to you
This comes from my family
And the ancient sea
A prehistoric impression
Of the modern krill
She feeds the noble whale
And offers you longevity
The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
Finally, please take good care in the heat
Sincerely yours

Or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
Stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
If this should be, I say if this should be
You of my heart, send me a little word
That I may go unto her, and take her hands saying
Accept all happiness from me
Then I shall turn my face
And hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands"

Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
Sounds go through the muscles
These abstract, wordless movements
Movements, movements, move
They start off cells that haven't been touched before
These cells, they're virgins
Waking up slowly

They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

Nothing will be the same

I like this resonance
It, it elevates me
I don't recognise myself
This is very interesting

And throw little things off
Like car parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around

A way to start the day

It's early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to thе sounds they make
On their way down

I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks

And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

You think you're denying me of something?
Well, I've got plenty
You're the one who's missing out
But you won't notice
Until after five years
If you live that long
You'll wake up
All loveless

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms
I'm so bored of cowards
That say they want love
Then they can't handle

You can't handle love, baby
You just can't handle

I think there was probably several things that brought me to that point, first of all i'd completed sort of a cycle i fell after doing Homogenic and Vespertine and Greatest Hits and I had a chance to go back to the beggining you know where I'm made from
Also, just on a musical level, I've been really spoilеd rotten like the Vеspertine Tour was done with 70 people on-stage, it was almost more people on-stage than in the audience and it's like, you know, I mean how spoiled rotten can you get, you know, where are you gonna go from here like 500 people on-stage, or 10000 you know, so it was kinda time for me to not have more bag of tricks just to go back and make things out of what i'm made of not just sort of show-off-y, you know
And then also i hate to admit it but i, the only way to tell the truth is to say that I was lightly affected by the whole 9/11 and, you know, all these people comming out of the woods that are obsessed with the book that was written 2000 years ago, so part of me wanted to make music that was made by humans like even before that or something and just come up with a better idea or something
So I was really keen on doing songs that would be quite full-bloodied and visceral just to prove that you didn't have to make a new-age album, like a linear album, if you're gonna make only vocals, or ambient albums, you know, with full respect to ambient the music but, eh
And it wasn't actually until the end of the album where it sort of slowly became possible, and actually realistic that it actually could be an all-vocal album, 'cus I did set up to work with a lot of vocals but maybe not be, like, puritan, you know
Also, I keep going back and back to is that when I was about 18 I was working- I was in a band called Kukl and we were all doing side-projects with eachother and I would do with the drummer, I would do this stuff where I was recording in the studio layers of myself, vocals, that sort of I would say is a bit out of the roots to Medúlla and also doing a project with a guitarrist from Kukl with this song Sidasta Eg is from"

Oh, oh

Darling, stop confusing me
With your wishful thinking
Hopeful embraces
Don't you understand?
I have to go through this
I belong to here where
No one cares, and no one loves
No light, no air to live in
A place called hate
The city of fear

I play dead
It stops the hurting
I play dead
And the hurt stops

It's sometimes just like sleeping
Curling up inside my private tortures
I nestle into pain
Hug suffering
Caress every ache

There's a beautiful view from the top of the mountain

And throw little things off

It's early morning, no one is awake
I'm back at my cliff, still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down
I follow with my eyes till they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks

And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I've seen it all, I have seen the trees
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
And lives that were over before they were spent
I've seen what I was, and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all — there is no more to see

Thom Yorke

You haven't seen elephants, kings, or Peru!
I'm happy to say I had better to do
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?
All walls are great if the roof doesn't fall

And the man you will marry?
The home you will share?
To be honest, I really don't care

You've never been to Niagara Falls?
I have seen water, it's water, that's all
The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?
My pulse was as high on my very first date
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
To be honest, I really don't care
[Verse 5: Björk & Thom Yorke]
I've seen it all, I have seen the dark
I have seen the brightness in one little spark
I've seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
And that is enough, to want more would be greed
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all —  there is no more to see

You've seen it all and all you have seen
You can always review on your own little screen

I'm a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
You're the bird on the brim
Hypnotised by the whirl
Drink me, make me feel real
Wet your beak in the stream
Game we're playing is life
Love's a two-way dream
[Chorus]
Leave me now, return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay
[Verse 2]
I'm a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You're the one who walks me
I'm your one-way street
[Verse 3]
I'm a whisper in the water
Secret for you to hear
You're the one who grows distant
When I beckon you near
[Chorus]
Leave me now, return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay
[Verse 4]
I'm a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You're the intruder's hand
I'm the branch that you break

You think you're denying me of something

We live on a mountain
Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain
Every morning I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around

It's become a habit
A way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's real early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes till they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I had a dream that I was missing you, indeed
And if I miss you then you know that I'll be there with speed
I got that mystical vibe for your mind, believe
I've never seen you but I've seen you got the vibes I need
That's why I miss ya, can't dismiss ya from my mind (
Miss you

Whole heap of people wan fi diss ya, but I seek to find
You got to send me an emotion, or a sign
'Cause even though we know all things must reveal in time
Still I miss ya (
Miss you, miss you
)

I can't stand the wait

I know by now that you'll arrive

So I can feel happier to be safe up here with you

I'm back at my cliff, still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down
I follow with my eyes till they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

First snow of Winter
I'm walking hills and valleys
Adore this mystical fog!
This fucking mist!
These cliffs are just showing off!
[Refrain 1]
Then the body memory kicks in
I mime my home mountains
The moss that I'm made of
I redeem myself
[Verse 2]
I've been wrestling my fate
Do I accept this ending?
Will I accept my death
Or struggle claustrophobic?
Fought like a wolverine
With my destiny
Refuse to accept what was meant to be
[Refrain 2]
Then the body memory kicks in
And I trust the unknown
Unfathomable imagination
Surrender to future
[Verse 3]
Oh, how to capture all this love
And find a pathway for it
Like threading an ocean through a needle
River through a keyhole
Can't fathom the grasp
I can't grasp the fathom
[Refrain 3]
Then my body memory kicks in
My limbs and tongue take over
Like the ancestors before me
Show me the flow
[Verse 4]
My sexual DNA
X-rays of my Kama Sutras
Summons different bodies
Compares spines and buttocks
And back of necks
[Refrain 4]
Then my body memory kicks in
It simply takes over
Bestiality
I redeem my body
[Verse 5]
I wasn't born urban
Toxic doesn't agree with me
Love lured me here
Into a stagnant state
My myths, my customs, ridiculed
Vacuum packed molecules
[Refrain 5]
Then my body memory kicks in
On this Brooklyn dance floor
Sweating with these rhythms
Rotate this matrix
[Verse 6]
All trapped in legal harness
Kafkaesque
Farce like patriarchy
Avoided to confront it
[Refrain 6]
Then the body memory kicks in
My warrior awakens
My turn to defend
Urban didn't tame me
[Refrain 7]
Then my body memory kicks in
All bosoms and embraces
Oral, anal entrances
Enjoy the satisfaction
If the other is growing"

All of my mouth was kissing him
Now, into the air, I am missing him
Is this excess texting a blessing?
Two music nerds obsessing
[Verse 2]
He reminds me of the love in me
I'm celebrating on a vibrancy
Sending each other MP3s
Falling in love to a song
[Verse 3]
This handsomest of wickermen
He asked if I could wait for him
Now, how many lightyears this interim
While I fall in love with his songs?
[Verse 4]
His hands are good in protecting me
Touching and caressing me
But would it be trespassing
Wanting him to be blissing me
Robbing him of his youth?
[Verse 5]
Cliffhanger like suspension
My longing has formed its own skeleton
Bridging the gap between singletons
Sending each others these songs
[Verse 6]
The interior of these melodies
Is perhaps where we are meant to be
Our physical union a fantasy
I just fell in love with a song
[Verse 7]
So, I reserve my own intimacies
I bundle them up in packages
My rawward longing far too visceral
Did I just fall in love with love?"

Maybe he will come out of this

Maybe he will come out of this loving me
Maybe he will come out of this

Maybe he will come out of this

Vietnam vet comes after the war
Lands in my house
This wild lion doesn't fit in this chair

Maybe he will come out of this loving me
Maybe he won't
I'm not taming no animal
Maybe he will come out of this
[Verse 2]
Once it was simple
One feeling at a time
It reached its peak then transformed
These abstract complex feelings
I just don't know how to handle them
Should I throw oil on one of these moods
But which one?
The joy peak
Humor peak
Frustration peak
Anything peak
For clarity
[Chorus 2]
Maybe he will come out of this loving me
Maybe he won't
I'm not taming no animal
Maybe he will come out of this
[Bridge]
Maybe he will come out of this
Maybe he won't
Somehow I'm not too bothered either way
Somehow I'm not too bothered either way
I refuse, it's a sign of maturity
To be stuck in complexity
I demand all clarity
[Outro]
Maybe he will come out of this
Or he will feel solitaire
Somehow I'm not too bothered
I'd just like to know"

Fall on my knees
Light the candles

Raise a monument of love
A swarm of sound
Our heads
And we can hear it
And we can get healed by it

It will make us a part of

My mouth was sewn up
Banned from making noise
I was not heard

Remove this hindrance
My throat feels stuck
I was not allowed
I was not heard
I was not heard
I was not heard
I was not heard

There is vocal sadness
I was separated
From what I can do
What I'm capable of
[Verse 4]
Need to break up
Vicious habits
Do something I haven't done
I haven't done before

In vow of silence
I explore the negative space
Around my mouth
It implodes
Black hole
With jaw fallen in
In fallen jaw
Jaw fallen in
I am not hurt
I am not hurt
[Verse 5]
This tunnel has enabled
Thousands of sounds
I thank this trunk
Noise pipe, noise pipe
[Verse 6]
I have followed a path
That took sacrifices
Now I sacrifice this scar
Can you cut it off?
